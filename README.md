# Empowering-Student-Success-A-Deep-Dive-into-Graduation-Data
Welcome to "Empowering Student Success," your data-driven portal into higher education. The repository offers a nice perspective on academic success, persistence, and the challenges faced by students on their educational journey.

## Introduction
Education is a journey, and we believe that understanding all aspects of this journey is vital for academic institutions, educators, policymakers, and students themselves. "Student Success" offers a variety of analyses and visualizations aimed at uncovering the secrets to student success, persistence, and the challenges they face. Education is the cornerstone of society, and understanding the dynamics that influence student success is paramount. This repository offers a comprehensive exploration of graduation patterns, dropout trends, and factors shaping students' academic journeys.

## Problem Statement
In today's educational landscape, institutions face significant challenges related to student retention, dropout rates, and program effectiveness. It's crucial to identify the underlying causes of these issues and work toward data-driven solutions. This project addresses these challenges by conducting comprehensive data analysis and deriving actionable insights from student graduation data. <br>
In order to solve these problems, I had to find answers to the following questions.
1. How many students have successfully graduated?
2. What is the average age of students at enrollment?
3. How many students are scholarship holders
4. How many students have an international background?
5. How many students have educational special needs?
6. What is the total number of students who have defaulted on tuition fees?
7. How many students have been displaced ?
8. What is the gender distribution among students?
9. What is the current status of Students?
10. What is top 5 courses for students at school?
11. What is the marital status distribution among students?

## Project Objective
 The aim is to examine the graduation trends and factors contributing to student success, understand Dropout Patterns, explore how long students typically remain enrolled and the factors influencing their decisions, Analyze the role of scholarships and implications of tuition fee defaults, assess the impact of age, special needs, and international status of students, understand gender distribution among students.  The task is to leverage SQL to explore and analyze the dataset, extracting valuable insights to aid in understanding the school's students data better. <br>
 **Dataset** I was provided with 3 different dataset. The datasets are attached to the repository
 The Graduation dataset
 Course dataset
 Marital Status dataset.

## Data Analysis
As we explore students' data, we will conduct extensive data analysis, visualization, and interpretation. I will use SQL queries to manipulate the data, Power BI for creating interactive visualizations, and provide detailed explanations. <br>
The first step was to create the tables in the database

1. How many students have successfully graduated? <br>
This query counts the number of students who have successfully graduated by filtering records where the "Target" column equals 'Graduate.' <br>
The result provides the total count of graduates in the dataset.
